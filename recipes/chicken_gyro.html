        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place Greek yogurt, cucumber, dill weed, 2 cloves garlic, white vinegar, 1 teaspoon lemon juice, 1 tablespoon olive oil, salt, and black pepper in a blender. Blend until smooth; set aside.</li>
            <li>Whisk together 4 cloves minced garlic, juice of 1 lemon, red wine vinegar, 2 tablespoons olive oil, and oregano in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Season to taste with salt and black pepper.</li>
            <li>Stir in chicken strips and toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade. Place chicken on a large baking sheet.</li>

            <li>Transfer cooked chicken to a plate and allow to rest for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; place each pita bread into the skillet until warm and soft, about 2 minutes per pita.</li>
            <li>Serve warmed pita bread topped with chicken strips, yogurt sauce, tomatoes, onion, and lettuce.</li>
