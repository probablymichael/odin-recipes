# odin-recipes

This is an part of The Odin Project HTML Foundations.
It's the last lesson, which is a project called "Recipes".

In this project, I use HTML to create a barebones website using the basic boilerplate and other elements such as <a>, images, unordered and ordered lists, etc. 

The content is about some recipes I've found online, their description, ingredients and even steps!
